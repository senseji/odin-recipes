    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade lemonade is so delicious and refreshing! This recipe is so easy to make and only requires a few ingredients. It’s perfect for a hot summer day.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white, granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup water (for the simple syrup)</li>
        <li>1 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 to 3 cups cold water (to dilute)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make simple syrup by heating the sugar and water in a small saucepan until the sugar is dissolved completely.</li>
        <li>While the sugar is dissolving, use a juicer to extract the juice from 4 to 6 lemons, enough for one cup of juice.</li>
        <li>Add the juice and the sugar water to a pitcher. Add 2 to 3 cups of cold water, more or less to the desired strength. Refrigerate 30 to 40 minutes. If the lemonade is a little sweet for your taste, add a little more straight lemon juice to it.</li>
        <li>Serve with ice, sliced lemons.</li>
    </ol>
